ABOUT ME
========

I'm Shourya — a CS and Business student at Northeastern who'd rather be building something than talking about building something.

I like solving problems that sit at the intersection of tech and business, whether that's architecting NLP pipelines processing half a million clinical trials, scaling a student org from zero to 200+ members, or figuring out how to match VCs with startups algorithmically.

I get restless when I'm not working on something, which is why I'm usually juggling a co-op, a couple side projects, and at least one organization that probably needs more of my attention.

I'm drawn to roles where I can build real things and lead teams doing the same. Not interested in busywork or meetings that could've been emails.

When I'm not coding, I'm producing music, playing poker, hunting for good food in random cities, or binge-watching shows I've already seen three times.
